# Welcome!
This was a class project developed by the collaboration of Christopher Naro and Zabir Rahman. 

The point of this project was to create a fully-functioning android application that creates and manages albums that store and categorize photos. Additionally, the app has functionality to view slideshows of the albums and the photos themselves.

Below you will see some screenshots of the android application's GUI
